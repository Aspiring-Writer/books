        <p>Homicide Detective Jared Clemmings has been working with the Boise Police Department for six years at the top of his class. He grew up on the streets and has connections in nearly every corner. There’s no other job he’d rather have and no other place he’d rather live.</p>

<p>Robert Johnson has worked in the police department for twelve years and has seen his fair share of murders, gangs, and suicides. He moved to Idaho and joined the BPD for a more quieter life in the job he enjoys.</p>

<p>Zipporah Crusoe is tired of running around the country to escape her past ghosts and Boise, Idaho looks like the perfect place to finally settle down and enjoy life. Unfortunately, ghosts always return to haunt you until they’re put to rest and she has some big and scary ones.</p>

<p>Together, the three get tangled up in kidnappings, murders, and political scandals that all seem to be dangerously connected. Someone, somewhere, is using them to reveal secrets that have been laid down for years and are tangled in ways that effects the whole city, and maybe even the entire country. The keys to unlock and untangle all of them lie in Zipporah Crusoe’s past and connections, if she has the courage to face those ghosts and find them.</p>
